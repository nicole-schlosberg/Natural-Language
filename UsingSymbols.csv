Notes
"The frequent and fluent use of symbols is a distinguishing characteristic of human thought and communication. Symbols free us from the bounds of our own direct experience and allow us to learn about the world from others. To use a symbol, children need to (1) understand the intention that led to the creation and use of the symbol, and (b) how the symbol relates to its referent. For example, to use a map, children need to know that it is intended to communicate spatial information, and how locations on the map correspond to locations in the world. In some cases, even very young children are capable of meeting both requirements. For example, infants quickly learn that people intend to communicate when they use words. Moreover, they quickly learn the meanings of many specific words and the objects or concepts that they stand for. In other cases, such as learning to use maps of large-scale space, children may struggle to understand what the symbol is intended to communicate and the specific relations between elements of the symbol and their referents in the world. Here we review the development of children’s understanding of words, photographs, scale models, maps, and text. We consider when and how children gain insight into the communicative intent of each of these symbols and how they learn to establish connections between the symbol and what it represents. This review helps to integrate research on the development of children’s understanding of a variety of symbol systems. "
"Using symbols is one of the defining characteristics of what it means to be human. Almost all children develop the capacity to use a variety of symbols and they fail to do so only under conditions of extreme deprivation. In contrast, only with extreme effort can non-human species understand and use the most basic human symbol systems. the acquisition of a variety of symbol systems is a major focus of early childhood education; within a few short years, children are expected to master numerals, letters, and often musical notation, computer icons, and many others. Children who master these symbol systems early in their education tend to do well"
symbol systems is a clear warning sign for poor academic achievement. 
"Defining what makes something a symbol is a notoriously difficult task, and this issue has been the focus of a great deal of work in a variety of fields, including philosophy, semiotics, linguistics, "
Other philosophical models go beyond this definition of symbols and point out the important role intention plays in understanding symbolic representations. symbols the act of interpretation. 
"philosophical definitions of symbols have pointed out three important components that maybe involved in symbolic understanding: a symbol, its referent, and the human interpretation that links the symbol with its referent. Building on these conclusions, we argue that the intention of both symbol creators and symbol readers contribute to the final understanding of symbolic representations. "
"On the basis of this analysis, we have chosen to use a definition that is inherently psychological: A symbol is something that someone intends to stand for something else. This definition is inherently psychological because ‘symbolness’ is defined in terms of psychological processes, such as intention and representation. Any object can become a symbol if someone intends for it to be. For example, imagine that you are at a dinner, and someone asks for directions back to their hotel. You could make a makeshift map on the tablecloth, using silverware to represent the locations of the restaurant, the hotel, and perhaps other locations. The silverware items become symbols when you make clear that you intend for them to represent locations "
"Based in part on these analyses, our definition of symbols implies two critical elements of symbolic understanding. The first is understanding the intention behind the symbol—knowing that someone intends for something else. The second is the stands-for relation—knowing how a symbol stands for its referent. "
"Particularly for young children, understanding "
"how a symbol relates to its referent often involves establishing correspondences between elements on or in the symbol and aspects of the referent. As is often true in young children’s developing understanding of relations, "
"There has been substantial debate regarding whether infants interpret photographs as symbolic representations. Much of the focus of this debate has been on demonstrations that infants attempt to grab at photographs of objects. found that 9-month-olds consistently grasped at the objects in photographs as if the photographs were the actual objects. In the original studies, infants were presented with picture books that showed one highly realistic photograph on each page. The photographed objects, such as bottles or plastic keys, were familiar to infants. Every infant made at least one attempt to grasp at one of the photographs, and some persisted across most of the photographs. There was also a large developmental change; 18-month-olds behaved dramatically different than the 9-month-olds did. The older children almost never grasped the photographed object. Instead, they often pointed to the represented object, making sounds (‘proto-labels’) that might indicate that they were trying to communicate something about the represented object. "
"notion is that all symbols have a dual nature; they are simultaneously objects in their own right and representations of something else. For children to succeed in the model–room task, they must focus on what the model represents, rather than on its properties as an object in its own right. "
"The research reviewed thus far indicates that for children to perform well in the model task, they must see it as a symbolic representation of the room. We believe that understanding the experimenter’s intention may play a very important role in this process. To succeed, the child needs to understand that the experimenter intends for the model to stand for the room. Adults are very familiar with this ‘stands for’ relation, and simply mentioning that something is a model of something else is probably sufficient for an adult to grasp how the symbol can be used. "
