Notes
"Do gestures merely reflect problem-solving processes, or do they play a functional role in problem solving? We hypothesized that gestures highlight and structure perceptual-motor information, and thereby make such information more likely to be used in problem solving. Participants in two experiments solved problems requiring the prediction of gear movement, either with gesture allowed or with gesture prohibited. Such problems can be correctly solved using either a perceptual-motor strategy (simulation of gear movements) or an abstract strategy (the parity strategy). Participants in the gesture-allowed condition were more likely to use perceptual-motor strategies than were participants in the gesture-prohibited condition. Gesture promoted use of perceptual-motor strategies both for participants who talked aloud while solving the problems (Experiment 1) and for participants who solved the problems silently (Experiment 2). Thus, spontaneous gestures influence strategy choices in problem solving. "
"When solving problems, people often select a strategy from among several possible options. What factors influence strategy choices? Past research has focused on characteristics of the problems, the context, and the solvers. Here we consider another possible factor: solvers’ body movements, and, in particular, their spontaneous manual gestures. Recent theoretical work suggests that gestures are based on simulations of perceptual states and actions. We investigated whether gestures influence problem-solving strategies by supporting mental simulations relevant to the problems. "
"This experiment tested whether the availability of gesture influences strategy choices. In the gesture-allowed condition, gesture was more strongly associated with perceptual-motor strategies than with abstract strategies. More crucially, partici- pants who were prohibited from gesturing were more likely than participants who were free to gesture to abandon perceptual-motor strategies and generate the parity strategy. Roughly half the participants in both conditions used this strategy in the first half of the problem set, but subsequent strategy choices differed between conditions. Very few participants in the gesture-allowed condition generated the parity strategy in the second half of the problem set, but a substantial number of participants in the gesture-prohibited condition did so. We suggest that participants who were allowed to gesture continued to use perceptual-motor strategies because gesture enhanced activation of such strategies. "
"In this experiment, participants’ talk-aloud protocols allowed us to assess strategies on each trial. However, it is unclear whether the results hinged on participants’ talking aloud. Does the availability of gestures directly influence problem-solving strategies, or does it influence talking aloud, which in turn influences strategies? Experiment 2 addressed this issue "
This experiment tested whether gesture influences strategy choices even when participants do not talk aloud. Participants who were not allowed to gesture were more likely to generate the parity strategy than were those who produced gestures. 
"Could this pattern be a side effect of gesture prohibition (i.e., due to discomfort or distraction, rather than absence of gesture per se)? We consider this unlikely, because participants in the gesture prohibited condition performed better than those in the gesture-allowed condition—more of them generated the more efficient parity strategy. The spontaneous nongesturers provide further evidence for our interpretation. Both gesturers and spontaneous nongesturers were allowed to gesture, so neither of these groups experienced gesture prohibition. Yet like participants who were prohibited from gesturing, spontaneous nongesturers were more likely than gesturers to generate the parity strategy. Taken together, our data indicate that the absence of gesture promoted the shift to the parity strategy (and that this shift was not a side effect of gesture prohibition). "
"Rotation gestures reflect simulation of gear movements, and ticking gestures reflect the layout of the gears in simulated space "
"Our findings add to the growing evidence that gesture facilitates cognitive processes, including both processes involved in speaking—such as activating visuospatial information, packaging spatio motor information into units relevant for speaking, and accessing words with spatial content—and processes involved in problem solving, such as spatial visualization, constructing problem representations, and bringing out implicit knowledge in spatio-motoric format. In all these cases, gestures serve to highlight and structure perceptual-motor information. "
"The effects of gestural facilitation of mental simulation may vary, depending on the nature of the problems. In this study, producing gestures made it less likely that speakers would gen- erate the highly efficient parity strategy; thus, gesture could be considered detrimental. However, when perceptual-motor information is important for problem solving "
