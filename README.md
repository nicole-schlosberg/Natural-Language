# Natural Language Processing

The use of natural language processing has exploded over the last decade. Appilcations that require machines to understand natural human speech patterns are abundant and substantial improvements in these systems has increased their utility. Within the educational space NLP is used to interpret human speech for the prupose of understanding human problems and recently an online tutor passed a limited version of the [Turing Test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test) when it was [indistinguishable from teaching assistants in a college class](http://www.news.gatech.edu/2017/01/09/jill-watson-round-three).

* Processed a set of documents of student notes that the class HUDK4050 made last semester 
* Ran a sentiment analysis of thise documents 
* Generated a topic model of those documents 

## Goals

* Understand and apply the basic process of natural language proceessing and the role of pre-processing text
* Understand and apply a simple sentiment analysis to a set of documents
* Understand and apply a latent dirichlet allocation to a set of documents
