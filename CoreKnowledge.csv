"the human mind is a flexible and adaptable mechanism for discovering regularities in experience: a single learning system that copes with all the diversity of life. On the competing view, the human mind is a collection of special-purpose mechanisms, each shaped by evolution to perform a particular function. The first view traces back to Enlightenment thinkers such as Locke (1689) and Hume (1748) and has been invigorated more recently by cognitive psychologists and neural network theorists ",,,,
"The second view was inspired by Darwin and gained prominence with the rise of evolutionary psychology. Much public discussion has focused on the diverging ways in which these views explain human behavior. Does a given ethnic group excel in mathematics because its members have studied more diligently, or because they have inherited greater talent? Do some adolescents join violent gangs because they learned aggressive behavior from their communities, or because they inherited a predisposition toward intergroup com- petition? Behind these specific questions lies a more general concern: To what degree can we human beings determine our fates and choose our futures? With enough cognitive work, can any person develop her mathematical talents and control her aggression? ",,,,
"Studies of human infants and non-human animals, focused on the ontogenetic and phylogenetic origins of knowledge, provide evidence for four core knowledge systems. These systems serve to represent inanimate objects and their mechanical interactions, agents and their goal-directed actions, sets and their numerical relationships of ordering, addition and sub- traction, and places in the spatial layout and their geo- metric relationships. Each system centers on a set of principles that serves to individuate the entities in its domain and to support inferences about the entities’ behavior. Each system, moreover, is characterized by a set of signature limits that allow investigators to identify the system across tasks, ages, species, and human cultures. ",,,,
"Goal-directedness, efficiency, contingency, reciprocity, and gaze direction provide signatures of agent represen- tations that allow for their study in non-human animals and in human adults. Newly hatched chicks, rhesus monkeys, and chimpanzees are sensitive to what their predators or competitors can and cannot see. These studies accord well with the physiological signatures of ‘mirror neurons’, observed in captive monkeys, which selectively respond to specific actions performed by the self and others. Mirroring behavior and neural activity occurs in human adults as well, and representations of goal- directed action guide adults’ intuitive moral reasoning. Together, these findings provide evidence for a core system of agent representation that is evolutionarily ancient and that persists over human development. ",,,,
"The core number system is structured around principles that contrast with both the object and the agent systems, and it shows its own distinctive signature limits. ",,,,
"Number representations with these properties have now been found in human infants, children, and adults, and in adult non-human primates. Infants discriminate between large numbers of objects, actions, and sounds when con- tinuous quantities are controlled, and their discrimina- tion shows a ratio limit. Infants also can add and subtract large numbers of objects. Adult monkeys and humans discriminate between large numbers of sounds, with a ratio limit, and they add and subtract large numbers as well. In adults and children, cross-modal numerical comparisons are as accurate as comparisons within a single modality. The precision of numerical representations increases with development, from a ratio of 2.0 in 6-month-old infants to a ratio of 1.15–1.3 in human adults, depending on the task . ",,,,
"Are there other core knowledge systems, with roots in our evolutionary past, that emerge in infancy and serve as foundations for learning and reasoning by children and adults? Recently, we have begun to investigate a fifth candidate system, for identifying and reasoning about potential social partners and social group members. ",,,,
"Core systems for representing objects, actions, numbers, places, and social partners may provide some of the foundations for uniquely human cognitive achievements, including the acquisition of language and other symbol systems, the development of cognitive skills through formal instruction, and the emergence and growth of cooperative social networks. Because learning of words and expressions depends on one’s pre-existing concepts, core concepts figure importantly in children’s word learning. Similarly, recent research suggests that core geometric representations guide devel- oping understanding of maps, even in remote cultures with no formal instruction. Core representations of number support preschool children’s mastery of counting and older children’s and adults’ learning and performance of symbolic arithmetic . Finally, a core sys- tem for representing potential social partners may guide infants’ and children’s ‘cultural learning’ : their acquisition of skills and behaviors that sustain life within a particular human group. In all these cases, core knowledge systems may support and advance human cognitive development, because the principles on which they are based are veridical and adaptive at the scales at which humans and other animals perceive and act on the world. ",,,,
"Despite these examples, we believe that the strongest message, from human history and developmental science alike, is positive. Although core conceptions are resilient, they can be overcome. The history of science and mathe- matics provides numerous examples of fundamental conceptual changes that occurred as thinkers became aware of the mismatches between the principles govern- ing their reasoning and the world of phenomena they sought to understand. Despite the pull of core concep- tions of Euclidean geometry and object mechanics, cosmologists and particle physicists can test whether space is non-Euclidean and has higher dimensions and they can use conceptions of massless, discontinuously moving particles to make predictions of astonishing precision. Conceptual change, moreover, is not the exclusive province of academic science. Preschool children change their conceptions of numbers when they learn to count, and they change their conceptions of agents when they learn about biological processes like eating and breathing.
